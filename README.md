Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn—the likelihood of a customer leaving a business—using machine learning techniques.
By analyzing customer data, applying preprocessing steps, and training multiple models, the goal is to identify the most accurate model for churn prediction.

# Dataset
The dataset contains customer details such as demographics, account information, and service usage.

Both numerical and categorical features are included.

The target variable indicates whether a customer churned or stayed.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Missing Value Visualization – Checked and visualized missing values.

Numerical Feature Analysis – Distribution and descriptive statistics.

Outlier Detection – Box plots to identify extreme values.

Correlation Heatmap – To study relationships between numerical features.

# Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data – Filling or removing missing values.

Label Encoding – Converting categorical columns to numeric values.

Feature Scaling – Standardizing numerical features.

Train-Test Split – Dividing data into training and testing sets.

# Handling Class Imbalance
Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance churn vs. non-churn classes.

# Model Training & Evaluation
Models Tested:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine

K-Nearest Neighbors

# Result:

Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy among the tested models using default parameters.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix

# Results Summary
Best Model: Random Forest Classifier

Performance: Outperformed other models in predictive accuracy and balanced classification metrics.

 # Future Work
Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

Try advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM.

Deploy model as a web app.
